Ruidi Zhao's R study note. 

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4)
y <- c(3,4,5,6)
```

`ls()` is used to look at a list of all of the objects <br>
`rm()` is used to delete any that we don't wat
```{r}
ls() 
rm(x, y) 
ls()
```
```{r}
rm(list=ls()) # remove everything at once
```

## Matrix
```{r}
x = matrix(data = c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
x
```

`byrow`的话就是按照row的方向排element
```{r}
matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)
```

## Random Variables
```{r}
# set.seed(0)
# So that you can reproduce the result

x = rnorm(50,mean = 0, sd = 1)
y = x + rnorm(50, mean = 50, sd = 0.1)
cor(x, y) # Get the correlation between x and y 
var(x)
sd(x)
```

## Graphics
The `plot()` function is the primary way to plot data in R. 
```{r}
x = rnorm(100)
y = rnorm(100)
plot(x, y, xlab = 'x-axis', ylab = 'y-axis', main = 'Plot of X vs Y')
```
